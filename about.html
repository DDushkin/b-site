      <h4>BiNeuro.com - Neuronet to manage your Google PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising campaign </h4>

      <p>In 2017, UCT WORLD CORPORATION <a href="http://www.uctworld.com">(www.uctworld.com)</a> was as the TOP 10 of Google’s fastest growing partners, owing to the BiNeuro system, the in-house version of which we have been developing and using since 2009.
On the advertising campaigns of our clients, BiNeuro shows a stable increase in the campaign's performance by at least 50%.
BiNeuro is an artificial intelligence system built on Data Science Technology: machine learning (neural networks), Big Data, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms.

</blockquote>
<p>The need to manage the multi-factor process in a qualitative way leads the company to a significant increase in the cost of organizing advertising campaigns, and this still does not save us from ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>Scaling BiNeuro by transferring on a WEB interface that allows a small advertising agency or freelancer independently and effectively carry out online advertising campaigns for small and large customers, is able to reformat the market volume of $ 220.83 billion in the short term.</p>

  <h4 class="my-4">By what BiNeuro improves efficiency and how it can be measured?</h4>
<p>BiNeuro is an artificial intelligence - a neural network that can learn and accumulate experience. The system becomes "smarter" with every Internet advertising campaign.
</p>
<p>Given the fact that the capacity of an expert in internet promotion is able to hold a maximum of 100 campaigns per year, BiNeuro has spent since 2009 more than 80 000 advertising PPC campaigns at Google, perhaps by human standards, be considered as digital expertise with the experience of 800 years!
During the campaign, BiNeuro takes into account from 1,000 parameters for small customers and up to 300,000 for large online stores and reacts to changes in the situation in 24/7 mode. For comparison, a high-end digital expert can "keep in mind" at best 40 parameters and can devote about one hour per a few days for your campaign.
</p>
<p>The value of the parameters in which the campaign gives maximum effectiveness (the achievement of KPI parameters of the campaign) is called the Targeted Image (TI) of the campaign. BiNeuro corrects the campaign itself and seeks to bring it to the Target Image.</p>
<p>
  BiNeuro contains not only neuro-optimization, but also a system of expert assessments The system stores the library of Target Images for the most successful campaigns geographically and industry-related, and when a new client appears, he immediately turns to a similar experience.
</p>
<p>
Using BiNeuro allows to increase the efficiency of PPC campaigns by at least 50% in 87% of cases and these parameters grow with the experience of the system.
</p>
<h4 class="my-4">
How can this be measured independently?</h4>
<p>
With the same budget, the number of conversions or targeted traffic (depending on the goals of the campaign) increases by at least 50% compared to the campaign configured by professionals.</p>
<p>
With the same budget, the number of conversions or targeted traffic (depending on the goals of the campaign) increases by at least 50% compared to the campaign configured by professionals.</p>
<p>
If an account with an already working analytics and conversion tracking (goals) is set up by the professionals of the TOP level, then in a maximum of 3 months the number of achievement goals increases by at least 50%. If you connect an account that was configured independently or not by professionals, then the effect may appear in a few days and the growth will be up to 20 times.</p>
<p>
You can see the effectiveness of the system yourself - by connecting your account to the system on the site bineuro.com and comparing the results before and after the minimum period of 1 month.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">
  Where does BiNeuro take so many parameters for tracking?</h4>
  <p>
  Google specialists have developed an effective, but complex system of artificial intelligence, which has become superior to human capabilities in its understanding:
</p>
<p>
       Google Adwords targeting limits:
  <ul class="list-unstyled">

    <li>
      No more than 5 million individual targeting elements in your account (for example, keywords, placements, and user category lists).</li>
      <li>No more than 1 million campaign targeting elements in your account (e.g., target locations and negative keywords at the campaign level).</li>
    <li>  No more than 10,000 targeted or excluded locations in the campaign, including up to 500 target areas within a radius.</li>
    <li>  No more than 20 general placement exclusion lists in your account (the maximum number of items in the list is 65,000).</li>
    <li>  No more than 65,000 excluded placements at the account level for each account (separate from lists, campaigns, and ad group exclusions).</li>
    <li>  No more than 128,000 excluded placements in an ad group (this includes exceptions for your account, lists, campaigns, and ad groups).</li>
    <li>  No more than 11 thousand total budgets in your account.</li>
    <li>  https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6372658?hl=ru</li>
  </ul>


</p>
    <p>
In addition, each target element in Google Adwords (as well as in other PPC advertising systems) is mapped to the system of the main hierarchical groups (MCC account, account, company, group, keywords, ADS), each of which includes 20 to 60 parameters, each of which can take from 2 to 150 values.
    </p>
<p>
For example, when you create an ad campaign for a single word or keyword, Google Adwords uses hundreds of parameters, not just such commonly known parameters as CTR, CPC, Avg.CPC, cost, Avg.pos, Interactions, Quality Score, Conversions, PTR , Search lost IS (rank), which are mostly targeted by advertising professional agencies.
</p>
<p>
And, for example, even such a simple task as decoding for the correct decision-making of such an important parameter as the CTR (ratio of transitions to impressions) of the key phrase can be different, depending on other parameters and their correlation, and also has a temporary cyclicity unique for each advertising campaign.
</p>
<p>
A human simply can not physically process such a large number of parameters, and this must be done regularly.</p>
    <p>
From the practical expirience of BiNeuro's work for 80 000 real advertising campaigns, the number of parameters taken into account often reaches 300 000.</p>
<h4 class="mt-4">
Who is our primary target audience and why is BiNeuro very important for it?</h4>
<p>
  Small and medium-sized advertising agencies, web studios and creative studios have difficulties with effective promotion of their customers.
</p>

<p>
  The skeleton staff for high-quality running of high-tech Internet campaigns includes:
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
     $ 1500 - specialist in contextual advertising</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - Remarketing Specialist</li>
    <li> $ 2000 - YouTube Promotion Specialist</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - specialist in adapting an advertising campaign to mobile platforms</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - analyst</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - marketer</li>
    <li> $ 3000 - security specialist (protection of contextual advertising from click fraud)</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - web developer</li>
  </ul>

</p>
<p>
Difficulties also arise from the need for administrative control and ensuring continuous data loading orders experts.</p>
<p>
There are unequal conditions for market participants, when large advertising agencies, due to large budgets for marketing and analytics, simply suppress small and medium-sized businesses. First of all, due to the manual work of high-level professional groups.</p>
    <p>
For small advertising agencies and freelancers, using BiNeuro will be especially revolutionary, because possessing only creative competence or even just having a client base they can provide technological service superior to the quality of service of major advertising agencies.</p>
<p>
Therefore, in the BiNeuro promotion strategy, we decided to make the main accent on the distribution of Internet marketing (WEB designers, SEO specialists, SMM, PR, rewriters, etc.) on advertising agencies and freelancers, and to grant this type of clients the status of BiNeuro Partners.</p>
<p>
BiNeuro allows Partners to build their business not only by providing technological outsourcing for PPC, SEO, KMC, SMM, etc., but also helps them find customers, allows them to use their brand, promotes their services in internal and external advertising, and also allows to use other opportunities that the Ecosystem provides.</p>
    <p>
Since BiNeuro supports advertising campaigns in all languages in which Google operates, and the user can work with the system completely autonomously, we expect that more than 340,000 advertising agencies, as well as 12 million freelancers in global Internet marketing will become our Partners.

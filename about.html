  <h4 class="my-4">By what BiNeuro improves efficiency and how it can be measured?</h4>
<p>BiNeuro is an artificial intelligence - a neural network that can learn and accumulate experience. The system becomes "smarter" with every new Internet advertising campaign.
</p>
<p>Taking into account the fact that a high-quality expert in Internet promotion is able to conduct a maximum of 100 advertising campaigns for a year, BiNeuro, which has carried out more than 80,000 advertising PPC campaigns in Google since 2009, can by human standards be considered a digital expert with 800 years of experience!
</p>
<p>During the campaign, BiNeuro takes into account from 1,000 parameters for small customers and up to 300,000 for large online stores and reacts to changes in the situation in 24/7 mode. For comparison, a high-end digital expert can "keep in mind" at best 40 parameters and devote the one hour in a few day for  a separate campaign.</p>
<p>
The value of parameters at which the campaign provides maximum efficiency (the achievement of KPI parameters of the campaign) is called the Targeted Image (TI) of the campaign. BiNeuro  corrects the values and seeks to bring them to the Target Image by itself.
</p>
<p>
BiNeuro contains not only function of neuro-optimization, but also a system of expert assessments. The system stores the library of Target Images of the most successful campaigns geographically and industry-related, and when a new client appears, BiNeuro immediately turns to the similar experience.
</p>
<p>
Using BiNeuro allows to increase the efficiency of PPC campaigns by at least 50% in 87% of cases and these parameters grow with the experience of the system.
</p>
<h4 class="my-4">
How can this be measured independently?</h4>
<p>
With the same budget, the number of conversions or targeted traffic (depending on the goals of the campaign) increases by at least 50% compared to the campaign configured by professionals.</p>
<p>
If an account with an already working analytics and conversion tracking (goals) is set up by the professionals of the TOP level, then in a maximum of 3 months the number of achievement goals increases by at least 50%. If you connect an account that was configured independently or not by professionals, then the effect may appear in a few days and the growth will be up to 20 times.</p>
<p>
You can see the  effectiveness of the system by yourself - by connecting your account to the system on the site www.bineuro.com and comparing the results before and after the minimal period of 1 month.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">
  Where does BiNeuro take so many parameters for tracking?</h4>
  <p>
  Google specialists have developed an effective, but complex system of artificial intelligence, which has become superior to human capabilities in its understanding:
</p>
<p>
       Google Adwords targeting limits:
  <ul class="list-unstyled">

    <li>
      No more than 5 million individual targeting elements in your account (for example, keywords, placements, and user category lists).</li>
      <li>No more than 1 million campaign targeting elements in your account (e.g., target locations and negative keywords at the campaign level).</li>
    <li>  No more than 10,000 targeted or excluded locations in the campaign, including up to 500 target areas within a radius.</li>
    <li>  No more than 20 general placement exclusion lists in your account (the maximum number of items in the list is 65,000).</li>
    <li>  No more than 65,000 excluded placements at the account level for each account (separate from lists, campaigns, and ad group exclusions).</li>
    <li>  No more than 128,000 excluded placements in an ad group (this includes exceptions for your account, lists, campaigns, and ad groups).</li>
    <li>  No more than 11 thousand total budgets in your account.</li>

  </ul>


</p>
    <p>
In addition, each target element in Google Adwords (as well as in other PPC advertising systems) corresponds  to the system of the main hierarchical groups (MCC account, account, company, group, keywords, ADS), each of which includes 20 to 60 parameters, each of which can take from 2 to 150 values.
    </p>
<p>
For example, when Google Adwords generates an ad campaign rating for a single word or a keyword phrase, it uses hundreds of parameters, not just such commonly known parameters as CTR, CPC, Avg.CPC, cost, Avg.pos, Interactions, Quality Score, Conversions , PTR, Search lost IS (rank), which are mostly oriented advertising agencies - professionals.
</p>
<p>
And, for example, even such a simple task as decoding such an important parameter as the CTR (click-through rate) for the passphrase may be different, depending on other parameters and their correlation, and also has a temporary cyclicity unique for each advertising campaign.
</p>
<p>
A human simply can’t physically process such a large number of parameters, especially if this must be done regularly.</p>
    <p>
On the base of the BiNeuro's practical experience of  80 000 real advertising campaigns, the number of parameters taken into account often reaches 300 000.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">
Who is our primary target audience and why is BiNeuro very important for it?</h4>
<p>
  Small and medium-sized advertising agencies, web studios and creative studios have difficulties with effective promotion of their customers.
</p>

<p>
  The minimal  staff for high-quality conducting high-tech Internet campaign includes:
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
     $ 1500 - PPC advertising specialist </li>
    <li> $ 1000 - Remarketing Specialist</li>
    <li> $ 2000 - YouTube Promotion Specialist</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - specialist in adapting an advertising campaign to mobile platforms</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - analyst</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - marketer</li>
    <li> $ 3000 - security specialist ( click fraud protection of PPC advertising)</li>
    <li> $ 1000 - web developer</li>
  </ul>

</p>
<p>
The need to exercise administrative control and constantly find orders for their uploading delivers additional complexity for small and medium-sized advertising agencies.</p>
<p>
There are unequal conditions for market participants, when large advertising agencies, due to large budgets for marketing and analytics, simply suppress small and medium-sized businesses. First of all, due to the manual work of high-level professional groups.</p>
<p>
For small advertising agencies and freelancers, using BiNeuro will be especially revolutionary, because possessing only creative competence or even just having a client base they can provide technological service superior to the quality of service of major advertising agencies.</p>
<p>
BiNeuro allows Partners to build their business not only by providing technological outsourcing for PPC, SEO, KMC, SMM, etc., but also helps them find customers, allows them to use their brand, promotes their services in internal and external advertising, and also allows to use other opportunities that the Ecosystem provides.</p>
    <p>
As far as  BiNeuro supports advertising campaigns in all languages in which Google operates, and the user can work with the system completely autonomously, we expect that more than 340,000 advertising agencies, as well as 12 million freelancers in global Internet marketing will become our Partners.
    </p>

<h3>The main types of Internet advertising</h3>
  <h4>1. PPC-advertising</h4>
  <p>PPC advertising is a text or text-and-graphics modules demonstrated at the sites that are in the context of an audience of advertising object, or a specific user. Basically, PPC advertising can correspond to the thematic focus of the site on which it is displayed, or displayed based on the searches / interests of the user.
The big advantage of PPC advertising is its targeting - the target orientation to the interests of the audience. PPC ads are shown only if the user has already shown interest in this topic, or when the advertised product corresponds to the topic of the site on which it is located. At the same time, payment for the demonstration of advertising is done in a personal manner, what is for the specific action of the user. Subspecies of PPC advertising - search engine PPC advertising provides access to the target audience. These are the customers who already know what they want to buy, and are just looking for where. An example of such a query in the search system: buy a tour to Egypt.
</p>
<h4>2. Banner / display /Programmatic</h4>
<p>Advertising, placed on banners (graphics media) - one of the first that appeared in the web space. Static or animated advertising objects are focused on attracting the attention of the audience. But it is quite difficult to call them targeted. As a rule, banners are used to increase the recognition of a product, trademark, brand, or to disseminate information about existing promotions, discounts, special offers. Among other types of Internet advertising, the media stand out with relatively low clickability - there are not too many transitions, but usually they are targeted. And with the right choice of the site give a good return in the end. Payment for placing banner ads is usually calculated by the number of impressions or the broadcast time - the fee for a click here is not relevant. Exactly the same scheme of cooperation offers both centralized sites that organize the placement of banners, and private owners of media resources. With the connection of Programmatic technologies this kind of advertising became more popular, because there was more information about the public of the sites and the system learned to target more qualitatively, which significantly increased the effectiveness of media advertising.</p>
<h4>3. SEO</h4>
<p>SEO-optimization can not be attributed to the category of Internet advertising, but the goals and objectives of these two areas of activity are general converge. In fact, due to SEO-optimization, the problems of attracting visitors, increasing the attractiveness, popularity of the web project with the audience are solved. And, in general, this is quite the same as what most advertisers want to achieve in the end.
SEO-optimization is always aimed at increasing the position of the site in the issuance of search engines. Accordingly, the higher position of the web resource, the more confidence it will cause the audience. Most of targeted account visitors falls on search traffic.. That is why search optimization in any case is recommended to include in a set of measures aimed at promoting goods and services.
Among the disadvantages of SEO - the need for permanent work with the site. It is the regular updating of content without loss of quality that will allow you to keep the positions you won after achieving the desired result. In addition, it is worth remembering that the processes of SEO are difficult to predict. For advancement, it may take  from several months to a year or two.
</p>
<h4>4. In SMM / SMO social networks</h4>
<p>Advertising in social networks is developing in two main directions - on the principle of targeting (contextual, media) SMM or SMO - marketing optimization of the promoted product within the selected site.
Many popular social projects have already launched their own advertising networks, which allow distributing advertising within the framework of the site taking into account its subjects and other parameters. This significantly simplifies the launch of advertising campaigns of any scale and allows you to plan not only further promotion, but also the budget spent for advertising funds.
</p>
<h4>5. CPA networks</h4>
<p>Promotion of the project through the CPA network allows you to receive customers with guaranteed efficiency for a particular project. The CPA network advertiser orders a fixed price conversion (the goals of the site). But, unfortunately, the share of low-quality motivated and frankly fraudulent traffic in this type of advertising is especially high and additional analytics and security measures are required.</p>
<h4>6. Influence marketing</h4>
<p>Influence marketing is the power of persuasion, which is applicable in any business sector. Many companies are convinced that this is one of the best way to increase the degree of confidence in their product on the part of the consumer. After all, the fact remains unchallenged - thanks to experts recommendations , authorities, celebrities, business developing faster and sales are increasing. Marketing influences also fosters brand awareness.</p>
